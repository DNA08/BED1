Before applying for a credit card with the Bank, a User might want to know his/her eligibility for the same. The Credit Card- Eligibility Validator application helps a potential credit card customer to find out his/her eligibility before applying for a credit card. The application would require the potential User to just entry his/her PAN card number and based on the credit score associated with every PAN card, the eligibility status is displayed to the User.
